Feature: Finding the ingress
  The ingress finder works out which ingress a call used: the forward proxy
  ingress (the full vendor address in the request line), the vendor URL in
  path ingress (see url-in-path.feature) and the Host header ingress (see
  host-header.feature).

  Scenario Outline: A full address in the request line is the forward proxy ingress
    Given the proxy is running
    When an app sends "PUT <address>"
    Then the call uses the forward proxy ingress
    And the vendor is <host> on port <port>

    Examples:
      | address                                    | host          | port |
      | https://api.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/1 | api.talon.one | 443  |
      | http://api.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/1  | api.talon.one | 443  |
      | https://api.talon.one:8443/v2/x            | api.talon.one | 8443 |
      | HTTPS://API.TALON.ONE/v2/x                 | api.talon.one | 443  |

  Scenario: The request line wins over the Host header
    Given the proxy is running
    When an app sends "PUT https://api.talon.one/v2/x" with the header "Host: other.example"
    Then the vendor is api.talon.one

  Scenario: Without listen.connect, CONNECT is not an ingress
    The CONNECT ingress needs an issuer to sign the certificates it shows
    apps (see connect.feature).
    Given the proxy is running
    When an app sends "CONNECT api.stripe.com:443"
    Then the proxy answers 501 Not Implemented with a Proxy-Status header
    And nothing is sent to any vendor

  Scenario Outline: Addresses the proxy refuses
    Given the proxy is running
    When an app sends "GET <address>"
    Then the proxy refuses the call
    And nothing is sent to any vendor

    Examples:
      | address                    |
      | ftp://files.example/a.txt  |
      | https:///v1/no-host        |

  Scenario Outline: Refused calls are still recorded
    Every request the proxy reads and refuses gets a minimal record and is
    counted (Peter, 2026-10-29).
    When an app sends <request>
    Then the proxy answers <status>
    And the record is minimal with hotline.ingress <ingress>, http.response.status_code <status> and error.type http_request_error
    And hotline.requests goes up by one

    Examples:
      | request                                               | status | ingress       |
      | "GET ftp://files.example/a.txt"                       | 400    | forward_proxy |
      | "GET https:///v1/no-host"                             | 400    | forward_proxy |
