Feature: The hotline-proxy program
  The proxy runs as one program, hotline-proxy, with three commands: run
  starts the proxy, validate only checks a config, and version prints the
  version. The config file is given only with --config. --trust-file adds
  trusted certificate issuers on top of the system's own. The program's own
  log lines go to standard error, one JSON object per line. Exit codes: 0
  after a clean stop, 1 for any failure, 2 for a wrong command line. These
  scenarios start the built program and look only at its output, its exit
  code and the network (Peter, 2026-10-28).

  Scenario: The version command prints the version
    When hotline-proxy is run with "version"
    Then it exits with code 0
    And standard output starts with "hotline-proxy "

  Scenario: Help is printed on request
    When hotline-proxy is run with "run --help"
    Then it exits with code 0
    And standard error says "-shutdown-timeout"

  Scenario Outline: A wrong command line is refused with exit code 2
    When hotline-proxy is run with "<arguments>"
    Then it exits with code 2
    And standard error says "<message>"

    Examples:
      | arguments                                  | message                         |
      |                                            | usage: hotline-proxy            |
      | start                                      | unknown command "start"         |
      | run                                        | --config is required            |
      | validate                                   | --config is required            |
      | run --config hotline-proxy.yaml --colour   | flag provided but not defined   |
      | run --config hotline-proxy.yaml --log-level loud | invalid value "loud"      |
      | run --config hotline-proxy.yaml extra      | unexpected argument "extra"     |

  Scenario: validate accepts a valid config
    Given a valid config file
    When hotline-proxy is run with "validate --config hotline-proxy.yaml"
    Then it exits with code 0
    And every line on standard error is a JSON object with time, level and msg
    And standard error says "config is valid"
    And nothing listens on the config's proxy address

  Scenario: validate refuses a config whose TLS key file is missing
    Given a config file whose listen.tls key file does not exist
    When hotline-proxy is run with "validate --config hotline-proxy.yaml"
    Then it exits with code 1
    And standard error says "listen.tls: the cert or key file cannot be read"

  Scenario: validate lists every problem of a config
    Given a config file with no version and no exporters
    When hotline-proxy is run with "validate --config hotline-proxy.yaml"
    Then it exits with code 1
    And standard error says "there is no version"
    And standard error says "there are no exporters"

  Scenario Outline: A trust file the program cannot use is refused
    Given a valid config file
    And <trust file>
    When hotline-proxy is run with "<command> --config hotline-proxy.yaml --trust-file trust.pem"
    Then it exits with code 1
    And standard error says "<message>"

    Examples:
      | command  | trust file                                 | message                     |
      | validate | no file trust.pem                          | trust file                  |
      | run      | a file trust.pem that holds no certificate | holds no certificate        |

  Scenario: run refuses a config with problems
    Given a config file with no version and no exporters
    When hotline-proxy is run with "run --config hotline-proxy.yaml"
    Then it exits with code 1
    And standard error says "there is no version"

  Scenario: run stops with exit code 1 when the proxy port is taken
    Given a valid config file
    And something else listens on the config's proxy address
    When hotline-proxy is run with "run --config hotline-proxy.yaml"
    Then it exits with code 1
    And standard error says "address already in use"

  Scenario: run logs to standard error as JSON
    Given a fake OTLP receiver
    And the hotline-proxy program runs with integration test-shop for the test vendor
    When the program gets SIGTERM
    Then it exits with code 0
    And every line on standard error is a JSON object with time, level and msg
    And standard error says "hotline proxy started"

  Scenario: The log level can be lowered
    Given a fake OTLP receiver
    And the hotline-proxy program runs with "--log-level warn" and integration test-shop for the test vendor
    When the program gets SIGTERM
    Then it exits with code 0
    And standard error does not say "hotline proxy started"

  Scenario Outline: A stop signal lets the call in progress finish
    Given a fake OTLP receiver
    And the hotline-proxy program runs with integration test-shop for the test vendor
    And the test vendor holds its answer
    When an app's call is in progress and the program gets <signal>
    And the test vendor then answers
    Then the app gets the test vendor's answer
    And it exits with code 0
    And the receiver got the call's record

    Examples:
      | signal  |
      | SIGTERM |
      | SIGINT  |

  Scenario: A stop that runs out of time exits with code 1
    Given a fake OTLP receiver
    And the hotline-proxy program runs with "--shutdown-timeout 1s" and integration test-shop for the test vendor
    And the test vendor holds its answer
    When an app's call is in progress and the program gets SIGTERM
    Then it exits with code 1 within 5 seconds
    And standard error says "stop ran out of time"

  Scenario: A second signal stops the program at once
    The usual stop waits up to 25 seconds; a second signal ends it now.
    Given a fake OTLP receiver
    And the hotline-proxy program runs with integration test-shop for the test vendor
    And the test vendor holds its answer
    When an app's call is in progress and the program gets SIGTERM
    And the program gets SIGTERM again
    Then it exits with code 1 within 5 seconds
    And standard error says "stop cut short"
