# The hotline-proxy program

The proxy from slice 1 runs as one program, `hotline-proxy`, in `src/hotline-proxy/cmd/`. It stays thin: it reads its command line, connects the real network, clock and log to the `proxy` package, starts the proxy and stops it. All decisions below are Peter's, 2026-10-28. The behaviour is written down in `src/hotline-proxy/features/program.feature`.

## What it does

1. **Commands.** `hotline-proxy run --config hotline-proxy.yaml` starts the proxy. `hotline-proxy validate --config hotline-proxy.yaml` only checks the config and the specs it points to, then exits. `hotline-proxy version` prints the version that Go recorded when it built the program.
2. **Config path.** Given only with `--config`. No default path and no environment variables. Without it the program stops with exit code 2 and says why.
3. **Listen address.** Comes only from `listen.proxy` in the config.
4. **Health checks.** `/livez` and `/readyz` on `listen.admin`, and the `--drain-delay` flag: built later, see [proxy-health-checks.md](proxy-health-checks.md).
5. **Logs.** The proxy's own log lines go to standard error (the program's error output), one JSON object per line. `--log-level` (debug, info, warn, error) sets the lowest level logged; the default is info. Help and usage text is plain text.
6. **Stopping.** On SIGTERM (what Kubernetes sends to stop a program) or SIGINT (Ctrl+C), the proxy stops taking new calls, lets calls in progress finish, and sends every queued record. It takes at most 25 seconds, set with `--shutdown-timeout`, so it ends before Kubernetes' usual 30 second limit. A second signal cuts the stop short.
7. **Exit codes.** 0 after a clean stop. 1 when it cannot start (config refused, trust file refused, port taken), or when a stop ran out of time or was cut short. 2 for a wrong command line.
8. **Trust file.** `--trust-file` names a PEM file (the usual text format for certificates) of extra trusted issuers for vendor certificates, added on top of the system's own. The vendor's certificate is still always checked. The end-to-end tests use it to trust their test vendor.
9. **Fixed settings.** Records are sent every second, and one send may take at most 10 seconds. Each run gets a new random `service.instance.id`.

## End-to-end tests

- `make e2e` builds the program, runs the scenarios tagged `@e2e` against it as a separate process, and writes the program's coverage to `e2e-cover.out`. `make test` runs them too and adds that coverage to the total.
- Without make: `go test -tags e2e -run TestEndToEnd .` from `src/hotline-proxy`. It builds the program itself. The normal `go test ./...` skips them.
- The tests reach the program only through its command line, output, exit code and the network: a local TLS test vendor at `localhost` and a fake OTLP receiver.
- Only the Go client cases from `research/matrix-clients/go` are in for now (cases 1 and 2). The Node, Java and Rust clients and the TLS cases (4 and 5) are tagged `@later`.
- The "host that does not exist" case looks up `nothing.invalid` through the real DNS resolver. `.invalid` is a name kept by RFC 6761 that never exists.
