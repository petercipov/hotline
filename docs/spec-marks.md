# Hotline's marks in a vendor spec

Hotline reads our copy of each vendor's OpenAPI spec. Where plain OpenAPI can't say what the proxy needs, the spec carries a mark of our own, a field whose name starts with `x-hotline-`. OpenAPI lets any tool add fields starting with `x-`, and other tools ignore them.

This page lists every mark, what it is for, and an example. Marks live only in our copy of a spec or in an overlay (a small file that changes a spec when it is loaded), never in the config. A mark the proxy can't use stops it at start, and `hotline-proxy validate` reports it.

**Adding a mark.** Only when a real example needs it (Peter, 2026-11-01). Add it to this page in the same pull request.

| Mark | Where | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| [`x-hotline-redact`](#x-hotline-redact) | a parameter, a reply header | which values may appear in the record |
| [`x-hotline-record`](#x-hotline-record) | a body field, a call header | copy one safe value into the record |
| [`x-hotline-body`](#x-hotline-body) | a body's media type | read a vendor's own content type as JSON or XML |
| [`x-hotline-action-header`](#x-hotline-action-header) | the top of the spec | the header that names the action, when every call has the same path |
| [`x-hotline-action-field`](#x-hotline-action-field-coming) | the top of the spec | the body field that names the action. Coming with SNS and STS |

## x-hotline-redact

**What it's for.** Records must never hold secrets or personal data. So by default the proxy hides every value in the path and the query (`REDACTED`), and keeps only a short list of harmless headers. This mark changes that for one value: `false` means "safe, keep it", `true` means "hide it".

**Use case.** A Stripe customer id in the path is safe and helps find a call, so it is kept. A Stripe search query may hold an email address, so it stays hidden.

```yaml
paths:
  /v1/customers/{customer}:
    get:
      parameters:
        - name: customer
          in: path
          x-hotline-redact: false   # url.full shows /v1/customers/cus_123
        - name: expand
          in: query                 # no mark: shows as REDACTED
```

**Rules.**

1. It goes on a path, query or header parameter, or on a reply header. It takes `true` or `false` only.
2. Path and query values are hidden unless marked `false`.
3. Headers kept without a mark: `content-type`, `content-length`, `date`, `retry-after`, `request-id`, `x-request-id` and any `ratelimit-*`. Any other header is left out, name and all, unless marked `false`. A header marked `true` shows as `REDACTED`.
4. Never recorded, whatever the mark: `authorization`, `proxy-authorization`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`, and the login headers and query values named in the spec's security section.

## x-hotline-record

**What it's for.** The proxy never records bodies. But some body fields say something useful and safe, such as which queue a message went to. This mark copies that one field into the record, under the attribute name it gives.

**Use case.** SQS puts the queue address only in the body, so without the mark you can't tell in Grafana which queue a call went to.

```yaml
QueueUrl:
  type: string
  x-hotline-record: messaging.destination.name
```

The record then holds `messaging.destination.name = https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/192325781350/invoices`.

It also works on a header of the call, for example to record the action:

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: X-Amz-Target
    in: header
    schema: { type: string, const: AmazonSQS.SendMessage }
    x-hotline-record: messaging.operation.name
```

**Rules.**

1. On a body field of the call or the reply (JSON, XML or form bodies), or on a header of the call. Never on a path, query or cookie value, a reply header, or a login header.
2. Only plain values: text, a number, true or false. Never an object or a list, and never a field inside a list.
3. The name uses letters, digits, dots and underscores. Names starting like the proxy's own (`hotline.`, `http.`, `url.`, `server.`, `network.`, `error.`, `dns.`, `tls.`, `log.`) are refused. Prefer OpenTelemetry's standard names, such as `messaging.destination.name` or `db.collection.name`.
4. Text is cut at 256 characters. The value goes into full records only, signed with the rest, never into the counter.
5. A mark is a promise that the field holds no secret and no personal data.

Detail: [proxy-body-fields.md](proxy-body-fields.md).

## x-hotline-body

**What it's for.** The proxy checks a body only when it knows how to read it. It reads `application/json`, the XML types and form bodies on its own. Some vendors use their own name for JSON or XML, and this mark says which it is. It takes `json` or `xml`.

**Use case.** AWS sends SQS bodies as `application/x-amz-json-1.0`, which is JSON under another name.

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    application/x-amz-json-1.0:
      x-hotline-body: json
      schema: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/SendMessageRequest' }
```

**Rules.**

1. It goes on a media type of a call or reply body. Any value other than `json` or `xml` is refused.
2. XML bodies are read by the schema's shape and OpenAPI's `xml` notes. A body with a DOCTYPE is refused, and namespaces are ignored.

Detail: [proxy-sqs-example.md](proxy-sqs-example.md), [proxy-xml-bodies.md](proxy-xml-bodies.md).

## x-hotline-action-header

**What it's for.** Some vendors send every call to the same path and name the action in a header. OpenAPI allows only one operation per path and method, so each action becomes its own route, written with the header value after `#`. This mark says which header that is.

**Use case.** Every SQS call is `POST /`, and the header `X-Amz-Target` says whether it sends, receives or deletes.

```yaml
x-hotline-action-header: X-Amz-Target
paths:
  "/#X-Amz-Target=AmazonSQS.SendMessage":
    post: ...
  "/#X-Amz-Target=AmazonSQS.ReceiveMessage":
    post: ...
```

A call to `/` with `X-Amz-Target: AmazonSQS.SendMessage` matches the first route, is checked against it, and its record's `url.template` is that route.

**Rules.**

1. It goes at the top of the spec. It belongs to the vendor's api, never to an integration.
2. A route matches only when the header has exactly its value. With the header missing or unknown, the call has no route and is not checked (`no_spec_route`).
3. A spec with `#Name=value` routes but no mark, or naming another header, is refused.

Detail: [proxy-aws.md](proxy-aws.md).

## x-hotline-action-field (coming)

*Agreed in the SNS and STS step, 2026-11-01; not built yet.*

**What it's for.** Like `x-hotline-action-header`, but the action is a field of the body, not a header.

**Use case.** SNS and STS send every call to `POST /` as a form body, and the action is the `Action` field.

```yaml
x-hotline-action-field: Action
paths:
  "/#Action=Publish":
    post: ...
```

A call whose body is `Action=Publish&TopicArn=...&Message=...` matches `/#Action=Publish`.

**Rules (planned).**

1. It goes at the top of the spec. A spec names the action by a header or by a body field, never both.
2. Only a top-level field of a form or JSON body is read, once the whole body has arrived, and only from bodies up to 2 MiB, the size the proxy keeps for its checks.
3. With the field missing or unknown, the call has no route (`no_spec_route`). The call is still forwarded unchanged.

## Other spec words the proxy reads

These are not our marks, but the proxy gives them a meaning worth knowing:

- **A query word after `#`** picks a route by its query, for vendors like S3: `/{Key+}#?tagging`. Several words join with `&`; a word with a value matches only that value. Detail: [proxy-xml-bodies.md](proxy-xml-bodies.md).
- **`{name+}`** takes the rest of the path, last part only, as in `/{Key+}`.
- **`contentMediaType` with `contentSchema`** on a text field: the text holds JSON, and it is checked against that schema. Used for the invoice job inside an SQS message. Detail: [proxy-sqs-example.md](proxy-sqs-example.md).
- **`contentEncoding: base64`** beside them: the text is base64, decoded before its check. Used for Kinesis records. Detail: [proxy-shop-example.md](proxy-shop-example.md).
- **`x-aws-pattern`**, written by `tools/aws-openapi`: an AWS pattern Go can't read. The proxy ignores it.
