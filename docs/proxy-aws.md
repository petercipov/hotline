# AWS through the proxy, starting with SQS: requirements

*Agreed with Peter, 2026-10-29; built 2026-10-30. Scenarios: `src/hotline-proxy/features/aws-sqs.feature` and `end-to-end-aws.feature`. The source of truth is `proxy-spec.md` in the `hotline-strategic` repo. The worked example is [examples/aws-sqs-invoices](../examples/aws-sqs-invoices/README.md); the message check it uses is in [proxy-sqs-example.md](proxy-sqs-example.md).*

## What the feature is

AWS signs every request with Signature Version 4 (SigV4). The SDK mixes the method, the path, the query, `Host`, a list of headers and a hash of the body with the app's secret key, and puts the result in `Authorization`. AWS redoes the sum and answers `403` if any of those parts changed. The proxy holds no AWS keys and cannot sign again.

Every SQS call is `POST /`. Which action it is (send, receive, delete) is named only in the `X-Amz-Target` header, for example `AmazonSQS.SendMessage`. This is AWS's JSON protocol, which SQS has used since November 2023.

What we checked with the real SDK (`service/sqs` v1.52.7):

- **Forward proxy works** when the app's SQS address is `http://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` and the proxy is `http://shop-a:x@hotline:8080`. Go adds `Proxy-Authorization` after signing. With the default `https` address, Go asks for a `CONNECT` tunnel and gets `501`.
- **Host header and transparent redirect work** when the app keeps AWS's own name and only changes how it connects (a custom dialer, or `hostAliases`).
- **Vendor URL in path cannot work.** The SDK signs the proxy's own name and the path `/https://…`, which the proxy has to change.
- **The integration ID must be added after signing.** Added through the SDK, it is signed; the proxy removes it, and AWS answers `403`.

## Requirements

1. **Signed calls stay valid** (Peter, 2026-10-29). The proxy forwards the method, the path and query as sent, `Host`, the body byte for byte, `Content-Length`, and every end-to-end header with its exact value. It only removes `Proxy-Authorization` and the headers for one hop (such as `Connection`), and may switch `http` to `https`, since the scheme is never signed. A body with a known length is never sent to the vendor in chunks of unknown size, also over HTTP/2. The proxy already behaves this way; this makes it a rule with a test.
2. **The integration ID stays in `Proxy-Authorization`** (Peter, 2026-10-29). The proxy never reads `Authorization`, for security reasons. A port per integration is ruled out, since integrations are unlimited.
3. **Each action is its own route in the spec** (Peter, 2026-10-29). AWS publishes no OpenAPI for SQS, only a Smithy model (AWS's own API description language), and Smithy's OpenAPI converter does not handle SQS's protocol. So we generate our own OpenAPI 3.1 spec from the Smithy model. OpenAPI allows one operation per path and method, so each action's route names the header value after `#`, the form the `aws2openapi` converter uses: `/#X-Amz-Target=AmazonSQS.SendMessage`.
4. **The action header is named in the spec** (Peter, 2026-10-29). A mark at the top of our spec, `x-hotline-action-header: X-Amz-Target`, says which header names the action. It belongs to the api, never to an integration, is never hard-coded in the proxy, and the config does not change. Like `x-hotline-redact`, it lives only in our copy of the spec.
5. **Matching a route with `#`.** A route `/#X-Amz-Target=AmazonSQS.SendMessage` matches a call to `/` whose `X-Amz-Target` header is exactly `AmazonSQS.SendMessage`. With the header missing or unknown, the call has no route (`no_spec_route`). The record's `url.template` is the route as written, so each action gets its own line.
6. **AWS headers in the record come from our spec** (Peter, 2026-10-29). Our SQS spec marks `x-amzn-RequestId` (AWS's request ID) and `x-amzn-query-error` (the error name) with `x-hotline-redact: false`. The default header list for all vendors does not change. `X-Amz-Target` need not be recorded, since the action is in the route.
7. **No patterns in `hosts`** (Peter, 2026-10-29). Each region's name is listed (`sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`, `sqs.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`, …), as for any vendor.
8. **The setup guide for AWS** (Peter, 2026-10-29):
   - recommends the forward proxy, set only on the SQS client, with the app's own HTTP client turning `https` into `http` after the SDK has signed (Peter, 2026-10-29). The SDK keeps its normal address and region, and the scheme is not signed. Tested with the real SDK. The Go setup:
     ```go
     type toHTTP struct{ next http.RoundTripper }

     func (t toHTTP) RoundTrip(r *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
         r = r.Clone(r.Context())
         r.URL.Scheme = "http" // after signing; the scheme is not signed
         return t.next.RoundTrip(r)
     }

     proxy, _ := url.Parse("http://shop-a:x@hotline:8080")
     transport := http.DefaultTransport.(*http.Transport).Clone()
     transport.Proxy = http.ProxyURL(proxy)

     client := sqs.NewFromConfig(cfg, func(o *sqs.Options) {
         o.HTTPClient = &http.Client{Transport: toHTTP{transport}}
     })
     ```
     Setting `BaseEndpoint` to `http://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`, or `HTTP_PROXY` with `NO_PROXY`, also works. `HTTPS_PROXY` with the normal `https` address does not: Go asks for a `CONNECT` tunnel and gets `501`;
   - says plainly that the vendor URL in path ingress cannot work for vendors that sign the host, such as AWS;
   - says the integration ID must be added after signing (by Go's proxy support, or a wrapper around the HTTP client), never through the SDK's own header options;
   - warns that setting `HTTP_PROXY` for the whole app also sends the SDK's own key lookups (`169.254.169.254`, `169.254.170.2`, `169.254.170.23`) to the proxy, where the internal address guard refuses them, so those go in `NO_PROXY`;
   - says that SQS reached through a VPC endpoint (a private entrance to AWS inside the customer's network) has internal IPs, so the api needs `allowInternalIPs: true`;
   - says `vendorTimeout` must stay above 20 seconds, since long polling keeps AWS silent for up to 20 seconds on purpose.

## Tests

### Signed calls stay valid (`aws-sqs.feature`)

The test uses a fixed, recorded request, signed once outside the repo with the SDK's signer, a made-up key and a fixed time: `testdata/aws/sqs-sendmessage-signed.http`. Hotline never imports the AWS SDK (Peter, 2026-10-29). The fake vendor needs no signing code: a signature stays valid exactly when every signed part arrives unchanged, so it checks the method, path, `Host`, body, and each header named in the fixture's `SignedHeaders`, read from its own `Authorization` line.

```gherkin
  Scenario Outline: A signed call reaches the vendor with every signed part unchanged
    The fixture was signed once by the AWS SDK: Host, path, body hash,
    Content-Length, X-Amz-Date, X-Amz-Target and the SDK's own headers.
    A signature stays valid when every signed part arrives unchanged
    (Peter, 2026-10-29).
    Given the recorded signed SQS call from the fixture, with Proxy-Authorization added after signing
    When the app sends it to the proxy over <ingress> with <protocol>
    Then every signed part reaches the vendor exactly as in the fixture
    And Proxy-Authorization is removed
    And the vendor receives Content-Length with the body's length, not a body in chunks

    Examples:
      | ingress           | protocol     |
      | the forward proxy | HTTP/1.1     |
      | the Host header   | HTTP/1.1     |
      | the Host header   | plain HTTP/2 |
```

### Routes named by a header (`aws-sqs.feature`)

- A call to `/` with `X-Amz-Target: AmazonSQS.SendMessage` matches `/#X-Amz-Target=AmazonSQS.SendMessage`, is checked against that route's body schema, and its record has that `url.template`.
- The same call with `X-Amz-Target: AmazonSQS.ReceiveMessage` matches the receive route instead.
- A call with no `X-Amz-Target`, or a value with no route, is skipped with `no_spec_route` and has no `url.template`.
- A spec with routes ending `#Name=value` but no `x-hotline-action-header`, or naming another header than the routes, is a broken spec: refused at start and by `validate`.

## Not in this step

- SQS's older query protocol (a form body with `Action=SendMessage`), sent by SDKs from before late 2023.
- Other AWS services.
- `CONNECT` with interception, the only way an unchanged SDK with its `https` address would work.
