# Example: a small shop on AWS, through Hotline

A small shop made of four apps, each its own Hotline integration, all in one Go program, `aws-shop`, using the AWS SDK for Go v2:

| App | What it does | AWS it uses |
|---|---|---|
| `checkout` | takes a payment: reads the payment key, saves the order, announces it, and asks for the invoice by publishing the job on the `order-paid` topic | Secrets Manager, DynamoDB `orders`, Kinesis, SNS `order-paid` |
| `invoices` | makes the invoice: first takes on its role, then reads the default template, gets the payment text, renders the PDF, stores it, signs it, saves its row, announces it | STS, SQS `invoices`, SSM, Lambda `payment-qr`, S3, KMS, DynamoDB `invoices`, EventBridge, Kinesis |
| `mailer` | mails the invoice: takes the announcement off its queue and sends the email with SES, PDF attached, or writes it to a folder | SQS `mail`, S3, SES |
| `refunds` | starts a credit note for a refund | DynamoDB `orders`, Step Functions |

The `order-paid` topic passes each job, as is, to the `invoices` queue. A role is a set of AWS rights: when the invoices worker starts, it takes on the role `invoice-worker` through STS and gets short-lived keys with only those rights, used for all its other calls. SNS and STS use AWS's older "query" form, where the action is a field of a form body; Hotline reads it to pick the route (see [docs/spec-marks.md](../../docs/spec-marks.md)).

Every app also writes its log lines to CloudWatch Logs, in a log stream named after the app. Each app puts its own name in the proxy address as the user name (`http://checkout:x@localhost:8080`), so Hotline's records say which app made each call. This is its own Go module, so the proxy never depends on the AWS SDK.

## The whole story in one go

[run-shop.sh](run-shop.sh) runs it all against the AWS resources that already exist, through Hotline: checkout pays a new order each run (such as A-20261101221714, from the date and time; any `A-` number is a sample order with A-1001's lines, and `ORDER` picks one), invoices makes the invoice (trying a few times, as the topic passes the job on a moment later), the mailer mails it (with SES when `MAIL_FROM` is set, to AWS's test inbox `success@simulator.amazonses.com`, which accepts the email and delivers nothing), refunds starts a credit note, and then two mistakes on purpose (a broken invoice job, and an order written to a table that is not checkout's own). It prints a summary, and stops at the first step that fails. It never creates or removes anything.

```
go run ../../src/hotline-proxy/cmd run --config ../../src/hotline-proxy/testdata/aws/hotline-proxy.yaml   # Hotline, in its own terminal
export AWS_PROFILE=<your profile> AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
MAIL_FROM=<an address verified in SES> HOTLINE_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 ./run-shop.sh
```

The steps should have no results in Hotline's records. The broken job should be reported on SNS's `Publish` with `body $.Message.eventId required` and more, and later on the invoices worker's `ReceiveMessage`. The wrong table should be reported with `body $.TableName const orders`.

## Commands

```
aws-shop checkout pay --order A-1001 --language en [--template default] [--send-to EMAIL]
aws-shop checkout send --body TEXT          # any text to the order-paid topic, unchanged: to try Hotline's checks
aws-shop invoices work [--once] [--out FOLDER]
aws-shop invoices status --order A-1001
aws-shop invoices fetch --order A-1001 --out FILE
aws-shop invoices list
aws-shop invoices cleanup --before 2026-11-01
aws-shop mailer work [--out FOLDER] [--once]
aws-shop refunds start --order A-1001 --amount 10.00 --reason returned
```

Every command takes `--proxy` (or `HOTLINE_PROXY`), `--endpoint` (or `SQS_ENDPOINT`, a local SQS), `--s3-endpoint` (or `S3_ENDPOINT`, a local S3) and `--sns-endpoint` (or `SNS_ENDPOINT`, a local SNS). The AWS region and credentials come from the usual AWS settings. Exit codes: 0 done, 1 failed, 2 a wrong command line.

- `invoices work` takes jobs off the queue. With `--out` it writes `invoice-<order>.pdf` to that folder instead of the bucket. It deletes a job it already handled, since SQS may deliver a message twice, and leaves a job it can't use on the queue. Give the queue a dead letter queue (a second queue where SQS moves messages that keep failing), so such jobs move aside. It waits up to 20 seconds for each receive, so Hotline's `vendorTimeout` for SQS must be above that. With `--once` it stops when the queue is empty.
- `invoices work` asks the `payment-qr` function for the payment text and prints it on the invoice. When the function fails, the job stays on the queue.
- `mailer work` sends the email with SES from `MAIL_FROM`, as a whole email with the PDF attached. With `--out` it writes `<order>.eml` to that folder instead. With neither, it stops with an error. In SES's sandbox (a new account's start), SES sends only to verified addresses and to its test inboxes.
- The orders and the two templates (`invoice-standard-v2`, `invoice-compact-v1`) are built in.

## The AWS resources

All in `eu-west-1`, in account `192325781350`. Each name comes from its environment variable, else the name here:

| Resource | Name | Variable |
|---|---|---|
| SQS queue for invoice jobs | `invoices` | `INVOICES_QUEUE_URL` (the whole URL) |
| SQS queue for the mailer | `mail` | `MAIL_QUEUE_URL` |
| S3 bucket | `shop-invoices-192325781350` | `INVOICES_BUCKET` |
| DynamoDB tables | `orders`, `invoices` | `ORDERS_TABLE`, `INVOICES_TABLE` |
| Kinesis stream | `shop-events` | `SHOP_STREAM` |
| EventBridge bus | `shop` | `SHOP_BUS` |
| Secrets Manager secret | `shop/payment-key` | `PAYMENT_SECRET` |
| SSM parameter | `/shop/invoices/default-template` | `TEMPLATE_PARAMETER` |
| KMS signing key | `alias/invoice-signing` | `SIGNING_KEY` |
| Step Functions workflow | `credit-note` | `CREDIT_NOTE_WORKFLOW` (the whole ARN) |
| CloudWatch Logs group | `/shop/aws-shop` | `SHOP_LOG_GROUP` (empty: no CloudWatch Logs) |
| SNS topic for paid orders | `order-paid` | `ORDER_PAID_TOPIC` (the whole ARN) |
| IAM role of the invoices worker | `invoice-worker` | `INVOICE_WORKER_ROLE` (the whole ARN; empty: no role) |
| Lambda function | `payment-qr` | `PAYMENT_QR_FUNCTION` (empty: no payment text) |
| SES sender | none | `MAIL_FROM` (an address or domain verified in SES; empty: the mailer needs `--out`) |

To create the ones that don't exist yet (the queue `invoices` does). The Kinesis stream and the KMS key cost money while they exist.

The files these commands read are in [aws](aws/): the queue's policy letting the topic send to it, the role's trust (who may take it on: people of this account) and its rights, and the function's code.

## The Hotline config

[hotline-proxy.yaml](../../src/hotline-proxy/testdata/aws/hotline-proxy.yaml) is the config the proxy's tests use, and a good start. Each AWS resource is an api, with the stable spec for its AWS service from [specs/aws](../../specs/aws/) and an overlay naming that resource and the shape of what is sent to it, such as [orders-table.overlay.yaml](../../src/hotline-proxy/testdata/aws/orders-table.overlay.yaml). Each app is an integration listing only the apis it uses. [shop.key](../../src/hotline-proxy/testdata/aws/shop.key) signs the records; it is an example and not secret, so put your own secret there, or use `fingerprintKey: { env: NAME }`. The overlays name the resources above, so change them for another account or region.

## How the clients reach Hotline

The code is in [shop/shop.go](shop/shop.go) and [invoice/queue.go](invoice/queue.go), following [docs/proxy-aws.md](../../docs/proxy-aws.md):

- only the clients of the shop's own resources use the proxy, so the SDK's own credential lookups never reach Hotline. The invoices worker's STS call is the exception on purpose: it takes on the shop's own role, so Hotline records it under `invoices`;
- keys from STS say which account they belong to, and newer SDKs would then send DynamoDB and Kinesis calls to a host named after the account. The shop turns that off, so each service keeps the one host the Hotline config names;
- the SDK keeps its normal `https` address and signs the call; the app's HTTP client then turns `https` into `http`, which is not signed, so the call reaches the forward proxy as a plain request Hotline can read. Hotline sends it on to AWS over `https`;
- the integration ID is the proxy address's user name. Go adds it as `Proxy-Authorization` after signing, so Hotline can remove it without breaking the signature.

## Tests

`go test ./...` here. Small fakes of SQS ([internal/fakesqs](internal/fakesqs/fakesqs.go)), S3 ([internal/fakes3](internal/fakes3/fakes3.go)) and the other AWS apis ([internal/fakeaws](internal/fakeaws/fakeaws.go)) also play Hotline's forward proxy, so the tests check what each app sends: the request line, `Proxy-Authorization`, the signed `Authorization` and `X-Amz-Target`. They need no AWS account and no network.

The proxy's own tests run this program through Hotline: `aws-shop.feature` runs the whole story with a fake AWS for every host, and `end-to-end-aws.feature` runs checkout through the real hotline-proxy program to a fake SNS over TLS.
