#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-shop.sh runs the shop's whole story in one go, through Hotline, on
# the AWS resources that already exist (see README.md). It never creates or
# removes anything.
#
#   1. checkout: a customer pays an order; it is saved and announced, and
#                the invoice job is published on the order-paid topic (SNS)
#   2. invoices: takes on its role (STS), then the PDF is made, with the
#                payment text from the payment-qr function (Lambda), signed,
#                stored, saved and announced
#   3. mailer:   the invoice is sent with SES when MAIL_FROM is set, else
#                written to ./mail
#   4. refunds:  a refund starts the credit note workflow
#   5. two mistakes on purpose, which still reach AWS and which Hotline
#      reports: a broken invoice job, and a write to a table that is not
#      checkout's own
#
# It expects Hotline to be running already, and reads the usual AWS
# settings (AWS_PROFILE, AWS_REGION, ...) and HOTLINE_PROXY. It stops at
# the first step that goes wrong, and says which.
#
#   HOTLINE_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 ./run-shop.sh
#
# Settings:
#   ORDER        the order to pay (default a new one each run, such as
#                A-20261101221714, from the date and time)
#   SEND_TO      where the invoice is mailed (default AWS's test inbox,
#                success@simulator.amazonses.com, which accepts the email
#                and delivers nothing)
#   MAIL_FROM    the sender, an address or domain verified in SES (default
#                empty: the email is written to ./mail, not sent)
#   WRONG_TABLE  the table for the second mistake (default orders-archive,
#                a table that doesn't exist, so nothing is written there)

Each app is its own integration in Hotline: look for the integration IDs
checkout, invoices, mailer and refunds in the records. The steps above
should have no results; the two mistakes should each have one:
  - the broken job:   body \$.Message.eventId required, and more, on SNS Publish
  - the wrong table:  body \$.TableName const orders
The topic passes the broken job to the invoices queue. The next time the
invoices worker runs, its ReceiveMessage is reported too, with
body \$.Messages[0].Body.eventId required, and the worker leaves the job on
the queue until SQS moves it to the dead letter queue.
